# Inventory Management System

## Project Description
This project is part of the Frontend Development (FFU1200) course and demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. It is a fully functional Pharmacy Inventory Management System that allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage information about different medicines in a clean and responsive interface.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a class-based structure and inheritance. All data is saved locally using localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
